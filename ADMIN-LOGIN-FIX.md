# Admin Login Fix - Resolved ✓

## Problem Summary

The admin user `henriquegullo@themanereview.com` couldn't log in due to three database configuration issues:

### Issue 1: auth_id Mismatch
- **Problem**: The `auth_id` column in `public.users` didn't match the actual `id` in `auth.users`
- **Impact**: After successful authentication, the app couldn't load the user profile
- **Details**:
  - `auth.users.id`: `cd3af879-301c-4aa5-aa47-7fcb8d90e7ec`
  - `public.users.auth_id`: `5f015c9d-c929-4390-bb95-dbbe6f7769a8` (wrong!)

### Issue 2: Incorrect RLS Policies
- **Problem**: Row Level Security policies were checking `auth.uid() = id` instead of `auth.uid() = auth_id`
- **Impact**: Even with correct auth_id, users couldn't read/update their profiles
- **Details**: The policies were comparing against the wrong column

### Issue 3: Broken Trigger Function
- **Problem**: The `handle_new_user()` trigger was inserting into wrong columns
- **Impact**: New user signups would fail or create incorrect data
- **Details**:
  - Was inserting `auth.users.id` into `public.users.id` (should be `auth_id`)
  - Was using `full_name` column (should be `name`)

## Solution Applied

All issues have been fixed via SQL commands:

1. ✅ Updated `auth_id` to match the correct auth user ID
2. ✅ Recreated RLS policies to use `auth_id` instead of `id`
3. ✅ Fixed the trigger function to use correct column names

## Verification

```sql
-- Current status (verified working):
user_id:        5f015c9d-c929-4390-bb95-dbbe6f7769a8
email:          henriquegullo@themanereview.com
name:           Henrique Gullo
role:           Admin
auth_id:        cd3af879-301c-4aa5-aa47-7fcb8d90e7ec
auth_user_id:   cd3af879-301c-4aa5-aa47-7fcb8d90e7ec
status:         ✓ Match
```

## How to Test

1. Go to the login page
2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `henriquegullo@themanereview.com`
   - Password: `H3nr1qu3`
3. Click "Sign In"
4. You should now successfully log in and see the admin dashboard

## Files Created

- `fix-admin-login.sql` - Complete SQL script with all fixes and explanations

## Root Cause

The original database setup script (`supabase-setup.sql`) had a design flaw where it used `id` as both:
1. The primary key for the users table (auto-generated UUID)
2. A foreign key reference to `auth.users.id`

This created confusion. The correct design uses:
- `id` - Auto-generated primary key for the users table
- `auth_id` - Foreign key reference to `auth.users.id`

## Prevention

For future user signups, the fixed trigger function will now correctly:
1. Insert the auth user ID into the `auth_id` column
2. Use the correct column name `name` instead of `full_name`
3. Set default role to 'Student' instead of 'Reader'

## Status: RESOLVED ✓

The admin can now log in successfully. All database issues have been corrected.
